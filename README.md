# Programming
Programming CA1 - Team Sugeeth, Arivoli and Sharon 

Ideas for a project - we could do a chatbot and code it in python, - I was thinking of setting up a website for a consultantancy practice where you can chat with a chatbot and it would point you to the part of the site from the answer you gave to the questions asked. We could use visual studio to code the website. 
Another idea could be an addition to the online booking system but not sure what we could do.

Whatever we decide we will need to be able to do the following CRUD - Create Review Update or Delete information stored in the program.

A chatbot helps save a lot of time when interacting with customers.
Using the ChatterBot Python library, we can create a simple chatbot. This library is designed to deliver automated responses to user inputs. When a user enters a specific input in the chatbot, the bot saves the input along with the response for future use. Every time a new input is supplied to the chatbot, this information enables it to provide automated responses. The first step in creating a chatbot in Python is to import all the necessary packages and initialize the variables we'll be working with.
To build a Python chatbot, we may also use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), another resourceful Python library package.


We organised a zoom meeting on Sunday the 19th June to discuss what ideas we all had. Arivoili and Sugeeth both had great ideas and will post them here.
We decided to work in ideas and meet on Tuesday it was agreed that sharon would set up visula studio code and link it to this repository Both HTML and PYTHON and the name is "The ChatBot"

As we discussed about creating a chatbot here are some frameworks that I think we can use to creat the bot Pandorabots, Botpress Botkit, RASA Stack, ChatterBot.

The Chatbot will ask the following 
Greet the user 
Ask their name 
and email addrees 
ask how can we help you today
The user answer which must relate to the website 
From the answer the chatbot can direct the user to a web page 
can we help further
User Yes - chatbot ask how - user answers 
Chat bot directs user

Sharon - designed the website and changes the colour scheme to suit the Programming Ca a contact page was added and the Chatbot was added. The chatbot is fully visable for the purpose of the Library adding and testing. 
This will be hidden with Opacity when ready to deploy. 

Arivoli - offered to do the Chatbot 

Sugeeth - was asked to do the contact page. 

Sharon - report summary The was an issue late on Wednesday the 20th July Pushing changes made by Sharon and another repository was set up to be able to add and show the work being done on the project. This was made public to all others but since the presentation Sharon made it Private again as Sugeeth had completed some changes and requested a Pull request and when the code was checked all the original code was changed which broke the website and pages were not visible. This was not pushed to the master branch for this reason. This is the link for the second repository.

In the design of the chatbot I used Python website - containers - css linked to the colorscheme of the webiste - fronted design using some of the code from Python-engineer on GitHub. This was due to the short notice and being asked to complete this element on Saturday 23rd - while working on my Web Technology Porject - Other attributes can be seen on the code itself and where I got different ideas for the website. - On Friday the 22nd of Jult I spent all evening trying to see where Sugeeth had messed up the code on the main branch and asked for a zoom meetihng Friday evening but he was not available so I met with him on Zoom onf Saturday morning. I made the mistake of not recording the whole conversation as it got very heated - he said he diod not change any of the code and that the contact page was now sending emails -  I have yet to see evidence. I set up the git repository the report on onedrive which I will upload to git once finished. I will do a video of my expierence and a personal reflection report and send them direct to paul with the assignment upload.  

I declare that the work done is my own and the only referencing is on my source code. Sharon Farrell

My changes are committed to  https://github.com/SharonF11/Programming/tree/send_notification_to_mail
It is not merged into the main branch.
I have integrated Sharon's work with Flask in this branch.
