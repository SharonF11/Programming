Programming CA1 - Team Sugeeth, Arivoli and Sharon 

Ideas for a project - we could do a chatbot and code it in python, - I was thinking of setting up a website for a consultantancy practice where you can chat with a chatbot and it would point you to the part of the site from the answer you gave to the questions asked. We could use visual studio to code the website. 
Another idea could be an addition to the online booking system but not sure what we could do.

Whatever we decide we will need to be able to do the following CRUD - Create Review Update or Delete information stored in the program.

A chatbot helps save a lot of time when interacting with customers.
Using the ChatterBot Python library, we can create a simple chatbot. This library is designed to deliver automated responses to user inputs. When a user enters a specific input in the chatbot, the bot saves the input along with the response for future use. Every time a new input is supplied to the chatbot, this information enables it to provide automated responses. The first step in creating a chatbot in Python is to import all the necessary packages and initialize the variables we'll be working with.
To build a Python chatbot, we may also use NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), another resourceful Python library package.


We organised a zoom meeting on Sunday the 19th June to discuss what ideas we all had. Arivoili and Sugeeth both had great ideas and will post them here.
We decided to work in ideas and meet on Tuesday it was agreed that sharon would set up visula studio code and link it to this repository Both HTML and PYTHON and the name is "The ChatBot"

As we discussed about creating a chatbot here are some frameworks that I think we can use to creat the bot Pandorabots, Botpress Botkit, RASA Stack, ChatterBot.
