Programming CA1 - Team Sugeeth, Arivoli and Sharon 

Ideas for a project - we could do a chatbot and code it in python, - I was thinking of setting up a website for a consultantancy practice where you can chat with a chatbot and it would point you to the part of the site from the answer you gave to the questions asked. We could use visual studio to code the website. 
Another idea could be an addition to the online booking system but not sure what we could do.

Whatever we decide we will need to be able to do the following CRUD - Create Review Update or Delete information stored in the program.
A chatbot helps save a lot of time when interacting with customers.
